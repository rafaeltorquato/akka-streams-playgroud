        //flow 1 - transform into the ids of each van (ie 1..8) with mapConcat

        //flow 2 - get position for each van as a VPMs with a call to the lookup method (create a new instance of
        //utility functions each time). Note that this process isn't instant so should be run in parallel.

        //flow 3 - use previous position from the map to calculate the current speed of each vehicle. Replace the
        // position in the map with the newest position and pass the current speed downstream

        //flow 4 - filter to only keep those values with a speed > 95

        //sink - as soon as 1 value is received return it as a materialized value, and terminate the stream
